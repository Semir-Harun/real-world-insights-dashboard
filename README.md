# 🇳🇴 Norwegian Transportation Analytics: A Data Science Story

## 🎯 The Problem
Norway's transportation sector is undergoing a **revolutionary transformation**. With the world's most aggressive EV adoption policies and extensive road infrastructure monitoring, **how do we quantify the relationship between policy-driven EV growth and actual traffic patterns?** 

Traditional transportation analysis treats these as separate domains, but Norway's unique position as an **EV adoption leader** presents an opportunity to understand the **interconnected dynamics** of sustainable transportation policy and infrastructure utilization.

## 💡 The Hypothesis
**Primary Hypothesis**: Norway's EV adoption surge (2020-2024) correlates with measurable changes in traffic patterns, and combining EV registration data with NVDB traffic monitoring reveals insights impossible to discover through single-dataset analysis.

**Secondary Hypotheses**:
- EV adoption shows **seasonal patterns** that align with traffic volume fluctuations
- **Regional differences** (Oslo vs Bergen) reflect varying EV infrastructure maturity
- **COVID-19 impact** affected both EV purchases and traffic volumes, creating natural experiment conditions

## 🔬 The Method: Multi-Dataset Analytics Pipeline

### � **Dataset 1: EV Registration Analytics**
- **Source**: Norwegian EV registrations (Oslo region, 2020-2024)  
- **Method**: Time-series decomposition, growth rate calculation, seasonal pattern analysis
- **Variables**: Cumulative registrations, monthly adoption rates, seasonal coefficients

### 🚦 **Dataset 2: Traffic Analytics (NVDB)**
- **Source**: National Road Database (Oslo E6, Bergen Rv7, 2020-2024)
- **Method**: Traffic volume aggregation, regional comparison, change-point detection  
- **Variables**: Daily traffic counts, monthly variations, COVID-19 impact markers

### 🔄 **Cross-Dataset Integration**
- **Temporal Alignment**: Monthly aggregation for both datasets (2020-2024)
- **Geographic Matching**: Oslo-centric analysis with Bergen as regional control
- **Statistical Methods**: Correlation analysis, seasonal decomposition, growth trend comparison

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Multi-Dataset Dashboard (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Semir-Harun/real-world-insights-dashboard.git

python -m src.analysis.prepare_multi --dataset both

# Launch multi-dataset dashboard
python -m streamlit run src/app/streamlit_multi.py
```

### Option 2: Individual Dataset Processing
```bash
# EV data only
python -m src.analysis.prepare_multi --dataset ev
python -m streamlit run src/app/streamlit_multi.py

# Traffic data only  
python -m src.analysis.prepare_multi --dataset traffic
python -m streamlit run src/app/streamlit_multi.py
```
